# SLF-Grape Water Based Density Separator

## Team: LanternBye Client(s): Cornell CALS Extension / E&J Gallo Winery / National Grape

## Problem statement

Grape growers are trying to collect grapes using mechanical harvesters, but both SLFs and grapes are
being harvested together, contaminating the product and causing financial losses due to inefficiency.
Obvious solutions are difficult to implement because SLFs don’t fly off when grape vines are shaken
during harvesting, causing SLFs and grapes to mix together in harvesting containers. Therefore, SLFs and
grapes must be separated during the harvesting process before they are stored and crushed together.

## Impact

Over time this will decrease the population of SLF. Ideally this doesn’t force growers to change their
existing processing systems and equipment. This should also increase the percentage of yield.

## Proposed Direction: Density Separator

**What it is:** A water-based separation system that uses density differences to separate SLFs from grapes
immediately after harvesting.
**How it would be used:**
● Mechanical shaker dislodges grapes and SLFs from grapevines
● Mixture enters a controlled stream of water
● Grapes sink and are collected in a drain at the bottom
● SLFs float and are diverted to another area for collection/extermination
**Why it’s better than the status quo:** There are no highly effective solutions that remove SLF from
grapes before harvest, our ideas will help increase grape crop yield.
**End-of-semester proof-of-concept:** We want to at least make a small scale model that can take a
mixture of SLF and grapes and with some margin of error separate them.

## Key Risks / Unknowns

```
● Strength of SLFs: If SLFs can hold on to the grapes for long enough, they will end up being
harvested alongside them. Test this by dropping SLFs holding grapes into water and observing
their behavior. If SLFs are able to hold onto grapes for extended periods, we can try adding
fruit-safe soap to the water solution to make it more difficult for SLFs to hold onto the grapes.
● Grape Submersion: Water exposure could impact grape quality or texture. Test by storing wet
grapes and dry grapes for extended periods of time and observing how they are affected. Evaluate
effective drainage methods and take these findings into consideration for our final design.

## Questions for the client

```
1) When in processing are grapes cleaned? Can this be integrated into that system to save time? If
grapes have soap on them, do they need to be rinsed again and or dried? This will tell us if we are
able to add soap to our water mixture.
2) At what point in harvesting does pulverization occur, and at what point does washing the grapes
significantly affect the yield? This will tell us if we can wash the grapes without lowering yield.
3) What is the main model of grape harvester used? What are the dimensions of collection bins?
This affects the size and placement of our device on the grapes harvesters they use.
